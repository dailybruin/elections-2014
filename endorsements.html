    <!--
    NOTE: For now, this is just very basic HTML to show what elements will be on the home page.
          We're looking at having a banner image across the top that will say "Elections 2014",
          then a series of tabs letting the user pick between the elections he/she wants to see,
          then the two candidates directly below that for governor. After the CSS is done, this
          will be a splitscreen view instead of having one candidate below the other, so you'd
          see one candidate and all of his/her details on the left and then the other candidate
          on the right.

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p><p style="color: #242424;">This board endorses Sheila Kuehl for the 3rd District seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors because of her experience in the California legislature and her dedication to advocacy.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Eight years as a state senator and six as a state assemblywoman will serve Kuehl well if she is elected this week. After managing a budget four times larger than she would in the supervisor seat, she is equipped to understand complex funding systems at the county level.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The UCLA alumna approaches her work with a profound understanding of the importance of standing up for marginalized communities and ensuring that the law protects the powerless. She learned this partially from firsthand experience with discrimination for being lesbian, even allegedly losing interviews because of it. At UCLA, she said she was kicked out of a sorority when her friends learned she loved a woman.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">As a senator, she wrote laws to guarantee workers paid leave and to protect students and school staff from discrimination for their sexual orientations. She also co-founded the nonprofit California Women’s Law Center, which works to produce legislation to protect women from assault and discrimination.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">On the job, Kuehl would have to oversee county prisons, the correctional system for youth and family welfare programs. A seat with this power requires a leader who knows what inmates and youth need. Her attention to mental health patients in jail and her strategy of diversion for low-level offenders make Kuehl right for the position. Her plans to offer additional support to foster care youth past the age of 18 and increase collaboration between child welfare programs will also benefit the county.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">While her opponent Bobby Shriver also supports diverting mentally ill people from jails, Kuehl’s stronger background in advocacy work makes her the more qualified candidate for this task.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Like Shriver, she supports an incremental minimum wage increase to $15.37 an hour. While Kuehl plans to use her alliance with unions, Shriver has said he supports providing tax breaks for companies. Unlike Shriver, Kuehl is rightly skeptical that tax relief for companies will stimulate the economy.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">L.A. County needs a leader who is dedicated to fighting discrimination and searching for ways to help the marginalized. Coupled with her history of advocacy, Kuehl’s experience helps ensure that county dollars and policies will be used and implemented with attention to groups who need the most care.</p></p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p><p style="color: #242424;">The board endorses Sebastian Ridley-Thomas to continue representing the 54th district in the California State Assembly.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Ridley-Thomas has served as the representative for the district since December 2013, when he was voted into office during a special election.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Since then, Ridley-Thomas has focused on a number of issues, most notably public health. His primary concern seems to be improving state-funded mental health care, particularly targeting communities with little to adequate care or those who are at high risk for chronic homelessness.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Ridley-Thomas said he has been particularly concerned with the way the state handles the mentally ill homeless. In the wake of an incident where a California Highway Patrol officer beat a mentally ill homeless woman who wandered onto the 10 Freeway, Ridley-Thomas held a special joint committee hearing with law enforcement officials to discuss their policies regarding the mentally ill.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">When asked about higher education, Ridley-Thomas discussed the importance of funding and investing in the University of California system. When pushed for details on how that investment should be made, Ridley-Thomas asserted that the most effective way to invest in the UC was to invest in students, notably through stronger financial aid packages for in-state undergraduates.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">In his short term, Ridley-Thomas has already proven his chops in Sacramento, demonstrating concrete success as a legislator. One measure he proposed, which allows the California Department of Justice to cross-reference databases to determine whether confiscated firearms are legally owned, was recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Ridley-Thomas was also involved with the passing of the affirmative consent or “Yes Means Yes” bill earlier this year.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Moreover, Ridley-Thomas is a strong proponent for the repeal of Proposition 209.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">While he noted that the measure is most associated with higher education admissions, Ridley-Thomas added that in order to help the repeal effort, advocates will need to focus on demonstrating the other costs Proposition 209 has, particularly in terms of how it affects business-sector job opportunities for women and minorities, stifling economic mobility.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">While Republican challenger Glen Ratcliff brings an important focus on small-business issues and a desire to reform the California tax code to the table, his statements on most issues were fairly vague and lacked concrete ideas for how to affect change in higher office.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Ratcliff's ideas about how to change K-12 education lacked both specifics and a practical understanding of how the state curriculum is set, and in particular, his statements regarding abolishing the minimum wage were particularly troubling to the board.</p></p>

            <h1 class="modal-title defineTitle">Proposition 1</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p style="color: #242424;">California is in the midst of one of the worst droughts in its history, and while the billions raised through Proposition 1 won’t go towards buying rainwater, it still represents a positive step toward securing the state’s water future.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The $7.12 billion proposal has allocations for certain water projects like ecosystem and watershed protection and improvements in drinking water quality, with the largest chunk – about $2.7 billion – going to water storage projects.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The money will flow into California’s aging water infrastructure, while also helping to develop a system that can reliably supply water in future years.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Of course, the projects outlined in the proposition don’t come cheap. The bond proposal is expected to cost the state $360 million annually over the next 40 years.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">However, not all the cost will be distributed to California taxpayers. A provision in the proposition requires certain projects to provide matching funds from non-state sources in order to receive bond funds.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Californians last voted on a water bond in 2006, approving $5.4 billion for water projects. In 2005, voters approved Proposition 50, which gave $3.4 billion for water projects.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">All this goes to show that Proposition 1 won’t be the last hard decision voters will have to make to secure California’s water future, but the measure represents a necessary part of the solution of supplying water to an increasingly thirsty state.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Opponents of the proposition have said that it is a waste of taxpayer money and beholden to special interests who plan to use the funding for dams to benefit large agricultural companies instead of the average Californian.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">But the current version of the proposition is already an updated version of an earlier $11.1 billion proposal which was pulled from the ballot and cut down for being too pork-laden.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The fund allocation for water storage projects also has no specific allowance toward dams. Instead, the independent California Water Commission is charged with identifying and supporting what they consider to be beneficial water projects.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">An analysis of the proposition by the non-partisan Pacific Institute noted that the measure’s effectiveness in addressing California’s water issues is contingent on how the commission performs in finding and pursuing effective water projects.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Proposition 1 won’t solve all the problems surrounding the current drought, but it will put plans in place that will help the state weather future water woes.</p>

            <h1 class="modal-title defineTitle">Proposition 46</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
          <p style="color: #242424;">Proposition 46 requires voters to make several important decisions about the future of their medical care and how it will be regulated in one comprehensive ballot measure.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">A stronger state prescription database, a higher pain and suffering cap for medical malpractice lawsuits and drug and alcohol testing for certain medical professionals – would lead to greater accountability and safety among medical practitioners in the state of California. But this board endorses a vote of “No” on Proposition 46, because the logistical concerns this proposition raises and potential financial impacts far outweigh its intended benefits.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">California currently ties for the lowest medical malpractice lawsuit damages cap in the nation: a maximum of $250,000 for pain and suffering, with additional damages possible to cover the economic effects of injuries caused by medical malpractice.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">This cap needs to be raised in the coming years. A higher cap would ensure more legal help for patients who have economically suffered from medical malpractice and hold the medical community accountable for its patient care.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">At the same time, the unknown costs of raising the pain and suffering cap to $1.1 million overnight provide reason for skepticism. Costs for medical care facilities in California would increase anywhere from “tens of millions of dollars to several hundred million dollars annually,” according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The proposition also calls for the random drug and alcohol testing of certain physicians. This board does not take issue with state-organized drug and alcohol testing of physicians in the event of medical mistakes or surgical errors, a move that could significantly reduce court costs. With no particular aim and no clear evidence of pervasive drug and alcohol use among doctors, however, randomized tests could prove wasteful due to significant administrative costs.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Proposition 46’s final measure would force providers to check the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, or CURES, a prescription drug distribution database. The move would curb the efforts of many “doctor shoppers,” or those seeking excessive amounts of prescription drugs, and limit the number of harmful pharmaceutical drugs disbursed. It is one this board approves if the state is willing to ensure all providers in the state are registered as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Proposition 46 aims to implement several measures that would, on the whole, improve the individual doctor’s practice of medicine. Its potentially overwhelming costs, however, indicate the need for more research and planning with respect to malpractice law and drug and alcohol use among physicians.</p>

            <h1 class="modal-title defineTitle">Proposition 47</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p style="color: #242424;">We strongly endorse a yes on Proposition 47 because it will reduce exorbitant prison spending and redirect the savings to programs that are proven to help reduce crime such as school truancy prevention.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">If passed, Proposition 47 would require misdemeanor sentences for the lowest level nonviolent crimes currently classified as felonies, such as certain drug possession and petty theft. It would also require resentencing for people serving felony sentences for these crimes.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The initiative presents a chance for Californians to reverse some of the devastating consequences of overcharging people for nonviolent crimes, a practice that perpetuates mass incarceration.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">By far, the U.S. outpaces all other democracies in incarceration. Although Americans make up roughly only 5 percent of the world’s population, we hold a quarter of the world’s prison population. The rate of incarceration in the United States has quadrupled since 1970, and more than half the inmates in state prisons are serving terms for nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">In California, state prisons are so overcrowded that the federal judges ruled them a gross violation of civil rights and ordered a cap on the number of inmates in 2009. This prompted an ill-conceived and costly prison realignment plan from Gov. Jerry Brown that shuffled thousands of inmates in state prisons to county jails, but did little to change the situation.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Despite lackluster results, state spending on corrections and rehabilitation increased by nearly $2 billion since 2011 when Brown began implementing his realignment plan.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates that the effects of Proposition 47 could eventually result in annual savings of hundreds of millions of dollars while allowing the state to really reduce <span class="st">–</span> not just relocate <span class="st">–</span> the prison population by several thousand inmates. They also estimate that counties could save several hundreds of millions of dollars annually, mostly from easing jail capacity.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">Savings in the state budget from Proposition 47 will be earmarked for programs that effectively improve public safety and help rehabilitate former convicts, including K-12 dropout prevention, mental health and drug treatment and services for victims of crimes.</p>
<p style="color: #242424;">We believe Proposition 47, backed by prominent law enforcement officers, Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles City Council , is a meaningful opportunity to scale back unjust, disproportionate sentencing for nonviolent crimes, a civic injustice with destructive social and economic consequences.</p>
